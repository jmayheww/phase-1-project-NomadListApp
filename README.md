# An intuitive city search and scoring app

> Satisfy your wanderlust, find a global destination, and embark on your next digital nomad journey!

## Project Philosophy

This project is motivated by the ongoing, pandemic-accelerated trend within the US workforce to engage in and normalize remote work opportunities. Thus, NomadList directly targets remote-workers seeking a change of scenery, aspiring digital nomads seeking their first big move, veteran expats mulling over a new location to set up shop, and anyone else yearning to live or travel elsewhere.

## General User Experience

The world is a vast and incredibly diverse place. This app makes it simple for users to search for cities from any continent or country and subsequently view a concise summary of city facts, a list of quality of life scores, and an overall aggregate city score for the selected city. Users can also select a second city to view alongside their first city search choice, which allows for a more comparative viewing of city quality of life scores that better aids users in their city decision-making.

## Specific Features

- Can search through hundreds of global destinations [teleport api](https://developers.teleport.org/)
- Can specify which continent and country you are interested in finding a city
- Can view individuaized profiles of each city, replete with an itemized and aggregate scoring of the city based on different quality of life criteria
- Can view two city profiles at the same time to enable easier comparison and highlight the contrast between different cities' quality of life scores

## How to Use

1. ***Start the search by selecting a continent from the dropdown menu labeled 'Choose a continent:'***
